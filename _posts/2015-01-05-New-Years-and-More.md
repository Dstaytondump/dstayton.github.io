title: New Years and More
summary: New Years resolutions and blog changes
---

So new years happened and I **did not** prepare well ahead of time. I decided to list my new years resolutions for everyone to see:
- I need to concentrate better in school. I want to make sure that I that do well in my classes at school.
- I need to do monthly blog posts. I have not followed through with the first rule of blogging, **never just stop blogging**. After thinking over what I should do to fix this I will starting today will post at least once a month.
- Lastly I want to finish my game that I have been working on to a point where it is respectfully pleasing to me. It does not mean that it will be done, but that it will be mostly finished.
